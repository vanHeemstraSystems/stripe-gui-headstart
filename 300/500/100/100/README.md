## 100 - Tools Used / Needed for our App

Let's take a look at all the tools will be using in order to create our application.

First, we'll need to have no jobs, which you can get at no jazz dog.

And there you can either install the staple version of note.

Which is at the moment eight point eleven, or you can grab the current version, ten point nine.

I'd recommend going at the stable version.

There seemed to be some issues with the current version at the moment, some bugs with it.

I'll be using the code editor visual studio code, you can grab that yourself at code, that visual

studio dot com for free.

And there you'll find options for Mac, Windows or Linux computers.

If you've wondered how we're going to be able to create a complete app from scratch within 90 minutes

with a front end, which will be creating with react, it's always a back end and a database will be

creating a database from scratch.

It's with the help of this tool satrapy.

Satrapy is a headless CMS.

It's a content management system which will allow us to, in a single command, create an API as well

as provide for us a user interface, just as you see right here.

It will give us a very simple, intuitive way to interact with our data to change things like rules

and permissions for our users to add plugins like Graphical, which will be working with it, will allow

us to do tons of stuff very easily.

And it's what ultimately will allow us to create our project really quickly.

This is a great tool to use, especially if you're a front end developer or you just don't like spending

a bunch of time creating an API satrapy is a free service that does all the work for you.

And you'll be surprised when you see how quickly we can create apps with it.

Will be using Stripe, the service stripe, in order to manage our payments, the payments that will

be processing within our app, again, another great service, it's entirely free.

So you can create an account now if you want to start working with Stripe, if you want to wait for

the relevant section in the course will be going through the set up process, the sign up process.

Step by step will be using the service and grid, the email service and grid in order to send emails

to our users, to people who check out.

And once again, this is an entirely free service, you can try it for free.

Of course, there are paid options, but will be using a really nice free tier and will be using Mahlab,

the database as a service mahlab to create and manage our Mongo DB database.

Now, we're not going to be working too much with Mongo DB or basically just going to create a database

with Mahlab and connect it to satrapy and Strappy will basically do all of the work for us.

And finally, we're going to be using react to create the front end to our application.

So we'll be using reactive tools to work with react things like props and state.

So if you're using Chrome, I'm going to show you right now how to add the Riak dev tools extension.

First, we want to go up to the window tab and go down to Extension's.

This will open up your external extensions panel at Chrome Kolan portals for extensions.

It'll show all the extensions that you have currently installed.

And you can see that I already have Riak developer tools installed.

I'll just remove that so I can reinstall it.

So the process of installing a new extension and up here at the top we have the extensions title to

the left of it.

We have this Hamberger icon.

If we click on it, we can see this extension side now open up and we want to go to the very bottom

and click on Open Chrome Webster.

So allow us to search for a particular extension and within the search, we'll type in react developer

tools.

And if we want to install the extension, we just need to click on Add to Chrome.

And it's going to confirm that we want to add it, so we'll click on ADD extension.

And hopefully we should see yet react developer tools has been added to Chrome.

So this is something we'll be working a lot with in a reactor application work with stuff like Prop

State, and you'll find if you're not if you haven't been working with it previously, it's a really

useful tool to use when you work with react.
